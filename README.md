### Hypothesis test example
In the WAGES data under datasets folder, let's test if wages are differenct between married and un-married workers.
#### Set up the purpose of analysis:
I selected the data set – “WAGES”. I want to know if there is an income difference between the married and the unmarried. I think there should be difference; the unmarried can concentrate more on work, make more income. The married have more distraction to family, relatively less time on work, so less wage.
