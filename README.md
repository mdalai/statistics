## Applied Statistical Method
This course covered all basics of statistics. I learned descriptive statistics, probabilities and inferential statistics. I learned to make hypothesis test, anova test, linear regression by the statistical software tool, MegaStat. All exercises were in Github ().

### Hypothesis test example
In the WAGES data under datasets folder, let's test if wages are differenct between married and un-married workers.
#### Set up the purpose of analysis:
I selected the data set – “WAGES”. I want to know if there is an income difference between the married and the unmarried. I think there should be difference; the unmarried can concentrate more on work, make more income. The married have more distraction to family, relatively less time on work, so less wage.
#### analysis:
- 1) get the data ready. Choose data that is necessary for this analysis and preprocess it, make it ready to data analysis.
the ready data should be seperated into two columns: married and unmarried. The data values are wages.
- 2)	State the Hypothesis:  
- H0: there is no income difference.
- H1: there is an income difference between the married and the unmarried.
- 3)	Set the significance level :  α =.05
- 4)	Run the hypothesis test: compare two independent groups

- P-Value = 0.0127. It is less than significance level α =.05. So we reject H0.   
- we can conclude that the married has higher wage than the unmarried.  
#### Conclusion:  
at the .05 significance level, there is an income difference between the married and the unmarried. The married workers have higher wages than the unmarried one. It is totally different than what I guessed in the beginning.
